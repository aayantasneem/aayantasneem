## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software developer evolving into an AI engineer — blending my backend experience with a growing passion for Python, data, and machine learning.

Over the last 2+ years, I’ve worked on backend systems using PHP, MySQL, and APIs. But today, I’m focused on solving real-world problems using Python — through automation, data exploration, and beginner ML workflows.

This GitHub is a reflection of my learning journey: hands-on projects, exploratory code, and scripts that turn **data into insights**.
